    <p>Learning how to code, create websites,<br>
       and technical writing has given me a<br>
        new level of confidence that wasn't<br>
         there before. MSIMBO, was the<br>
        gateway to a new life in tech. Thanks to <br>
        the Urban League, I had the experience<br>
        that awarded me a fellowship with<br>
        Hack.Diversity, which included a paid<br>
        internship as a technical writer at<br>
        Vertex Pharmaceutical.
